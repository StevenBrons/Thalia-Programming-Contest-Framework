# Thalia-Programming-Contest-Framework

TODO

## How to get started:
We advise you to base your bot on one of these provided starter bots:

You can run your bot by running the ```ClientRunner.py``` script in the framework directory.
This script has an optional argument to use another config file.

In this directory you will also find a config file. By changing it you can configure:
- The name of your team
- Whether to enable the clientside visualiser
- Whether to write the bot stderr to a file (you can use this to debug your bot)
- Where to connect to the server (you probably won't need to change this)
- What command to run to run your bot.
