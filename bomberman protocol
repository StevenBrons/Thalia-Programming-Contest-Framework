================================
The (base) bot's state machine would look as follows:
Start in the config phase.
Accept all CONFIG messages until START GAME. The bot responds to none of these.

The bot then enters the play phase.
When the bot receives a REQUEST MOVE, respond with a clientcomm.
Otherwise, accept UPDATE and result messages without responding.
